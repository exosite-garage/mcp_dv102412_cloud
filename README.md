About Microchip DV102412 Exosite Cloud Demo
============================================
This project is for Microchip DV102412 using a Microchip WiFi MRF24WG0MA module to demo Exosite's cloud<br>
connectivity to send and receive data to/from Exosite's Cloud Data Platform.<br>

Project functionality includes:<br>
1) New device activation on Exosite cloud and save CIK to NVMemory.<br>
2) Periodically sends 'Heart Beat' data to draw a triangle wave to Exosite cloud.<br>
3) Sends button press report to Exosite cloud to trigger an email alert.<br>
4) Reads 'LED' data source on Exosite cloud to turn device LED1 on and off.<br>

Tested and developed on IDE MPLAB X IDE v1.80 for DV102412.<br>

========================================
Validate Firmware and Hardware Versions
========================================
1) Firmware - based on Microchip library "microchip_solutions_v2013-02-15" and TCP/IP Stack version "v5.42.06 Feb 2013".<br>
NOTE: Find version information in "Microchip/TCPIP Stack/TCPIP Stack Version.txt".<br>
2) Hardware - Microchip DV102412, and WiFi module MRF24WG0MA 124145D.<br>

========================================
Quick Start
========================================
1) Install MPLAB XC32 Compiler v1.21.<br>
http://www.microchip.com/mplabxc32windows <br>
2) Install MPLAB X IDE v1.80 for DV102412.<br>
http://www.microchip.com/mplabx-ide-windows-installer <br>
3) Download the latest project repository from "https://github.com/exosite-garage/mcp_dv102412_cloud/archive/master.zip".<br>
4) Extract the project and open the project folder "mcp_dv102412_cloud/TCPIP/WiFiGDemo/WiFiGDemoBoard" with MPLAB X.<br>
5) Confirm power switch is ON and AAA batteries are installed, then plug in the PICKit3 and USB cable to your PC.<br>
6) Compile the project and download the program to the board (Run -> Run Project). This process might take several minutes.<br>
7) Use a smart phone or laptop that can select the WiFi Access Point labeled "MCHP_G_****" to provision device AP.<br>
8) Open http://192.168.1.3, to load Configure Network page, click "Display Scan Results", select your SSID, input your passphrase and save.<br>
NOTE:
   1. If you see a "Future home of Mchp error notification." message during your AP setup, you should reboot your device and scan for APs again.<br>
   2. Every time you want to turn on the dv102412, please confirm the AP is on-line, otherwise you'll waste many time for waiting<br>
9) LED1 will blink 2 times and the device will auto reboot. Make sure that LED2 blinks 4 times to signify that the board has the correct firmware version.<br>
NOTE: View 'Device Status' section below for more information about LED messages.<br>
10) When LED0 blinks rapidly for a couple of seconds, the WiFi Access Point has been set successfully.<br>
11) Create a free account on microchip.exosite.com.<br>
12) Activate your account.<br>
13) Log in, and click the "Add Device" link from the home page.<br>
14) Add a "DV102412 - Wi-Fi G Demo Board" device and input the MAC address shown on the welcome webpage of Microchip Wifi module.<br>
15) Wait up to 40 seconds for the device to activate on your account.<br>
16) Click the device on the "Your Devices" widget.<br>
17) Control the LED using the On/Off switch widget.<br>
18) When the module is connected and activated, the device will send a "ping" value periodically.<br>
19) When you need to change the WiFi Access Point after the device provision, you should check the SSID and IP on datasource of portal.<br>
20) Use a smart phone or laptop that can select the WiFi Access Point, and the device's current SSID/IP(Local IP, Local SSID) is indicate on portal.<br>
21) Connect to the current IP of device, to load Configure Network page, replay the option 2.<br>

========================================
Device Status
========================================
LED0
- Blinks continually = WiFi set successfully

LED1 - reset WiFi
- Blinks 2 times = Sets the WiFi Access Point, and it also reboot the device.
- Blinks 3 times = Erases the WiFi Access Point

LED2 - device bootup
- Blinks 2 times = WiFi module firmware version is 0x30.
- Blinks 4 times = WiFi module firmware version is 0x31.
- Blinks 6 times = WiFi module firmware version is unknown.

LED2 - runtime
- No Blinks = Device does not connects to cloud
- Blinks 1 time continually = Read, write and provision successful
- Blinks 2 times continually = No internet connection
- Blinks 3 times continually = Device not found on cloud
- Blinks 4 times continually = CIK invalid
